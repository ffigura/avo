# Synthetic tests to:

## 1_avo_synthetic.ipynb

  1: Reproduce the Figures 2 and 3 from Gidlow and Smith (1987)
    1.1: Implement Aki and Richard (1980) and Shuey (1985)

  2: Reproduce the Figure 3 from Chapter 4 in Chopra and Castagna (2014).
    2.1: Analyse AVO with the implementations in 1.1
    2.2: Plot RC, wavelet and an offset gather (Normal incidence)
    2.3: Generate and plot an angle gather from Shuey (1985) 2 terms' approximation
